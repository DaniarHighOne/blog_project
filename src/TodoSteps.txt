Here I gonna write down some steps which is about to take to build carefully and thoroughly.

1. Check libs and connection to tomcat see that jsp and other connections are work.
2. Create a DB and check connection to it, cause mostly projects starts with planning db itself.
3. Create main classes which was given in task.
4. Create HomeServlet for checking connections and tha will be the main page of blog.
5. I guess that it will be the List<Blog> show on main page, so we start from it..-->
6. For admin privilege better add some if checking by email(if User user not to show details and managing tools
but if email == admin email => show details button for moderating
